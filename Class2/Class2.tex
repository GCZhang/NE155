\begin{frame}{How do we measure utility?\footnote{en.wikipedia.org}}

\textbf{IPS} (Instructions Per Second) is a measure of a computer's processor speed. IPS can be useful when comparing performance between processors made from a similar architecture but are difficult to compare between CPU architectures

\textbf{Clock rate} typically refers to the frequency at which a CPU is running. It is measured in the SI unit Hertz.

\textbf{FLOPS} (FLoating-point Operations Per Second) is a measure of computer performance, useful in fields of scientific calculations that make heavy use of floating-point calculations. 

%\begin{equation}
%\text{FLOPS} = \text{cores} \times \text{clock} \times \frac{\text{FLOPs}}{\text{cycle}}
%\end{equation}

\begin{frame}{Computational Science/Engineering}
\textcolor{dgreen}{Computational Science} seeks to gain understanding principally through the analysis of mathematical models on high performance computers.\\
\vspace*{0.25 in}
The term \textcolor{dgreen}{computational scientists} has been coined to describe scientists, engineers, and mathematicians who apply high performance computer technology in innovative and essential ways to advance the state of knowledge in their respective disciplines.\\
\vspace*{0.25 in}
Thus, we distinguish it from \textcolor{dgreen}{computer science}, which is the study of \emph{computer and computation} and \emph{theory and experiment}, the traditional form of science.

\begin{frame}{What are we trying to accomplish?}
\begin{itemize}
\item The challenge of designing a nuclear reactor is to make it as economical as possible while insuring its safety.
\item This is not an easy task!
\item The principle of a nuclear reactor is relatively simple:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fission creates heat within the nuclear fuel,
\item The heat is conducted to the fuel cladding surface and to the coolant,
\item The heat is subsequently transported by a coolant through heat exchangers and ultimately to a steam conversion plant.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{What are we trying to accomplish?}
\begin{itemize}
\item In order to design economical and safe reactors, one must choose among a vast range of competing designs:
\begin{itemize}
\item What are the best fuels, structure, and coolant materials; what are their appropriate ratios?
\item How does the reactor respond to component failures?
\item How does one balance those choices given competing goals of performance, lifetime, safety, and capital cost?
\end{itemize}
\item Ideally, one would like to base these choices on theory rather than experimental trial and error.
\item This is where \textcolor{dgreen}{computational science} fits in...

\begin{frame}{Adolescence -- Early 1980s}
\begin{itemize}
\item NE was at the forefront of computer applications (!)
%pushing the envelope for ever greater computing resources and related advances in computational science.
\item Major early success story in the computational sciences:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reduced the burden of experiment
\item Contributed greatly to reactor design
\end{itemize}
\item However, modeling was severely constrained 
%Even state-of-the-art machines such as Cray-1 were 
\begin{itemize}
\item Unable to explicitly model the key physical phenomena within a reactor
\item Low-dimensional representation
\item Lumped parameter models
\item Empirical correlations with tunable parameters established largely by experiments
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Adolescence $\rightarrow$ Today's Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
\item Computing limitations caused
\begin{itemize}
\item Heavy reliance on expensive and often complicated experiments
\item Inaccuracy resulted in \emph{significant design margins} $\rightarrow$ negative impact on plant economics
\item Exploration of novel reactor design concepts was greatly constrained 
%by fundamental limitations in the predictability of the models
\end{itemize}
\item Many codes developed then are still used 
\item Can we update these tools?
\item Do we need to design new tools?
\item What methods will take us into the future?
\item What will the architectures look like?
\item How do we successfully navigate that interplay?

to solve problems that were \emph{previously unthinkable or impractical} in terms of the computing power required to address them

However, these computer simulations will not completely eliminate the need for \emph{experimental or measurement data} to confirm or ``validate" the software.

%"Traditionally, reactor models for radiation dose assessments have considered just the reactor core, or a small part of the core," Wagner says. "However, we're now simulating entire nuclear facilities, such as a nuclear power reactor facility with its auxiliary buildings and the ITER fusion reactor, with much greater accuracy than any other organization that we're aware of." 
%
%More accurate models enable nuclear plants to be designed with more accurate safety margins and shielding requirements, which helps to improve safety and reduce costs. The technology that makes this sort of leading-edge simulation possible is a combination of ORNL's Jaguar, the world's fastest supercomputer; advanced transport methods; and a next-generation software package called Denovo.
