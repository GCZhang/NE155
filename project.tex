Below is a list of possible term projects (there are Monte Carlo and deterministic options). If you are interested in some other project, write an outline and please discuss it with me. Also, if you intend to share a project amongst a team of students (maximum 3 students per team), check to ensure that the project has sufficient scope. The project is 30\% of your grade and is due on May 5. The following schedule will be imposed:

\vspace*{2 em}
\textbf{April 7:} Decide which project to work on; turn in list of team members (if applicable) and a 1-page abstract of project, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item what you plan to do
\item major steps to execute the project
\item deadlines associated with each step
\item what you need to do to accomplish each step (laying out a path to success)
\item if in a team, the division of work
\end{itemize}

\vspace*{2 em}
\textbf{April 21	:} Submit written report (4 pages maximum) explaining your project, preliminary results, and plans for completion.

\vspace*{2 em}
\textbf{May 5 and 7:} In class presentations (between 5 and 15 minutes, depending on project and team size) containing
\begin{itemize}
\item a project description, 
\item approach taken / methods used, and 
\item results and conclusions
\end{itemize}  (what exactly is included will vary by project). 

\vspace*{2 em}
\textbf{May 9:} Final written reports (~6-7 pages/team member as rule of thumb) are due.

\vspace*{2 em}
Your report grade will be based on the quality of your written report and oral presentation (rubric to be provided).
