\noindent\textbf{Course Description:}
Computational methods used to analyze radiation transport described by various differential, integral, and integro­differential equations. Numerical methods include finite difference, finite elements, discrete ordinates, and Monte Carlo. Examples from neutron and photon transport; numerical solutions of neutron/photon diffusion and transport equations. Monte Carlo simulations of photon and neutron transport. An overview of optimization techniques for solving the resulting discrete equations on vector and parallel computer systems.

\noindent\textbf{Academic Honesty}:  The University provides some basic guidance about academic integrity: http://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct/integrity. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor.
