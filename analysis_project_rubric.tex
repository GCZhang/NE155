The final paper should be $\sim$6-7 pages per team member. Please include these items in the \underline{final report}:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Introduction:} What are you trying to accomplish and why? Also preview what you are going to talk about.

\item \textbf{Problem Description:} Describe the problem you are solving in this work and explain how it will help you find out the thing you told us about in the introduction.

\item \textbf{Description of Work:} What did you do to perform your analysis? This can include any models you built, data you collected, strategies you needed for evaluation, etc.

\item \textbf{Results:} What did you find out?

\item \textbf{Conclusions:} What do your findings mean? How does that relate to the goal you laid out in the introduction?

\item \textbf{References}
\end{enumerate}

\vspace*{1em}
Your \underline{mid-project report} should replace Conclusions with \textbf{Plans for Completion}, keeping in mind that results will be preliminary or possibly empty. The first three sections don't have to be completely polished, but they should at least be very solid drafts. I will provide feedback, so the better they are when I read them the more useful the feedback will be. This should be up to $\sim$4 pages for one person and up to $\sim$7 pages for two people.

\vspace*{2em}
Please include these same items in your \underline{final presentation}. For projects with one person, aim for 10 minutes and projects with two people aim for 18 minutes.

I will use the following rubric for evaluating the paper:

\vspace*{1 em}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabu}{| X | c | c |}\hline
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Possible Points} & \textbf{Earned Points} \\ \hline \hline
Work implemented correctly & 15 & \\ \hline
Goal, problem solved, and analysis conducted have an appropriate logical flow & 12 & \\ \hline
Conclusions are supported by the results & 10 & \\ \hline
Complete sentences; correct grammar and spelling & 8 & \\ \hline
Sources properly documented & 5 & \\ \hline
Total & 50 & \\\hline
\end{tabu} 
\end{center}

This rubric is for evaluating the presentation:

\vspace*{1 em}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabu}{| X | c | c |}\hline
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Possible Points} & \textbf{Earned Points} \\ \hline \hline
Topic motivation is clear & 3 & \\ \hline
Explanation of work is understandable, correct, and supports the motivation & 7 & \\ \hline
Results and conclusions are clearly communicated & 6 & \\ \hline
Good presentation skills: eye contact, volume, clarity of slides, etc. & 6 & \\ \hline
Appropriate presentation length & 3 & \\ \hline
Total & 25 & \\\hline
\end{tabu} 
\end{center}
