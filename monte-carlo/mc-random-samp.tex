\begin{frame}{Physics as Probability}

Various physical phenomena can be
represented by probability distributions

\begin{itemize}
  \item Photon emission energy
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Each possible energy has a different probability
(intensity)
    \end{itemize} 
    \pause
    \vspace*{0.5 em}
  \item Scattering cross-sections
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Each possible scattering angle has a different
probability as a function of the energy
    \end{itemize}
    \pause
    \vspace*{0.5 em}
  \item Transmission through a medium
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Probability of reaching a particular position
depends on the cross-section
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Probability Density Functions}

All variables, $x$, have a \underline{Probability Density Function (PDF)}, $p(x)$, with the following characteristics:

\begin{columns}
  \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
    \begin{center}
    \textcolor{berkeleygold}{\underline{Continuous}} 
    \end{center}
    %

    p(x) & \geq 0 \\
    \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x)dx &= 1

    P(x = x_k) &= p_k \equiv p(x_k)\\
    k &= 1, \dots, N \\

    p_k & \geq 0 \\
    \sum_{k=1}^N p_k &= 1

  \end{column}
\end{columns}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Cumulative Distribution Functions}

All PDFs, $p(x)$, have an associated \underline{Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)}, $P(x)$, with the following properties:

    \textcolor{berkeleygold}{\underline{Continuous}}

\begin{frame}{Why Random Sampling}

Various physical phenomena can be
represented by probabilistic distributions

\begin{itemize}
    \item The known probability distribution
represents the \textit{collective} behavior
\vspace*{1em}
    \item We need to know the behavior at \textit{each}
single event
\vspace*{1em}
    \item We need to \underline{recreate} the collective behavior after \underline{many} events
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Random Sampling Purpose}

Use a random process to select a single
value with the following requirements

\begin{itemize}
    \item Each sample should be independent from
other samples
\vspace*{1em}
    \item The PDF formed from a large number of
samples should converge to the initial PDF
\vspace*{1em}
    \item Recover the full resolution of the initial PDF
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Sampling Techniques}

Random sampling uses \underline{uniformly distributed
random variables} to \alert{choose a value for a
variable} according to its probability density
function

    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Basic} sampling techniques
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Direct discrete sampling
      \item Continuous discrete sampling
      \item Rejection sampling
      \end{itemize}
    \pause
    \vspace*{.5em}
    \item \textit{Advanced }sampling techniques
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Histogram
      \item Piecewise linear
      \item Alias sampling
      \item Advanced continuous PDFs

Sampling Procedure

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Generate $\xi$
    \item Determine $k$ such that $P_{k-1} \leq \xi \leq P_k$
    \item Return $x = x_k$
